# ShowRoomVR
Sixth Form Project,
This project was made in 2016-2017.

ShowRoom VR was a proof-of-concept virtual reality application designed to work seamlessly with all mobile phones. 
The goal was to provide a simple yet powerful way for architecture clients and real estate agents to showcase their property catalogs in VR.

Using a streamlined hot-loading system, the application could dynamically import 3D models from the web and integrate them into a virtual environment. 
Clients could then explore these spaces using an affordable VR headset, such as Google Cardboard, making immersive property viewings accessible to anyone with a VR-capable Android device.
